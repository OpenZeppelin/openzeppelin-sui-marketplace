1. Open the [Learning Path Map](/docs).
2. Begin with [00 Setup + Quickstart](/docs/00-setup).
3. Keep going using the Prev/Next links at the bottom of each chapter.

## 2. Choose your goal

1. I want a local chain and published package -> [05 Localnet workflow (end-to-end)](/docs/05-localnet-workflow).
2. I want to understand shared objects + dynamic fields -> [07 Shop Object + Capability Auth](/docs/07-shop-capabilities) then [08 Listings + Typed Receipts](/docs/08-listings-receipts).
